Must install header files for libraries gsl and json-c

On Ubuntu 20.04:
    1. Download json-c and follow installation directions (cmake, make, make install)
        git clone https://github.com/json-c/json-c.git
        mkdir json-c-build
        cd json-c-build
        cmake ../json-c
        make
        sudo make install
    2. Install gsl headers via the command line
        sudo apt-get install libgsl23  # Try this first
        sudo apt get install libgsl-dev  # Do this if compiling with the below command can't find gsl

To compile: In this directory use the command to generate our hanm executable (obvi make sure to have gcc installed)
    gcc HANM.c -o hanm -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm -ljson-c



Running the Program:



All parameters:

json_network_file  --> Contains two arrays, coordinates and masses in json format  -> Use the Python Networks Python files to do this
json_rmsf_file  --> Contains one array, the rmsf per particle -> The target RMSF for each particle, use the anm_parameterize script in oxpy
temp      --> Start with this uniform force constant, leave it 0 to use the optimal force constant of ANM");
k0      --> Start with this uniform force constant, leave it 0 to use\n             the optimal force constant of ANM");
cutoff  --> Atom pairs of distance within the cutoff (nm) will be connected\n             by a harmonic bond");
factor  --> How large a restraint potential will be add in each cycle we would use factor*3KBT*3/8pi^2*(Bcal-Bexp)/(Bcal*Bexp)");
mcycles --> Number of outer cycles, updating B factors
ncycles --> Number of Inner cycles, fluctuation matching
outfile --> Output File Name, use a .json extension
mthreshold_abs --> Convergence Criteria for Bfactors, default is 0.1
nthreshold --> Convergence Criteria for Force Constants, default is 0.001
fcfiles --> (Optional) Provide a force constant file to use values inside


Calling the program:

hanm json_network_file json_rmsf_file temp k0 cutoff factor mcycles ncycles outfile
